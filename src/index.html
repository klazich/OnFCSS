      Css and Scalability<br class="dn-m">

    <p id="first-p" class="lh-title lh-copy-ns mv3 mv4-ns f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80">
      Several years ago I got curious about how css worked at scale. When I first started out,
      there weren’t nearly as many learning resources as there are now. There were a few books
      that my friends lent me and a couple of decent blog posts. But css was still pretty new
      and most people hadn't started to think deeply or learn hard lessons about concepts of
      maintainability when working with teams on large web apps.
    </p>
    <p class="lh-title lh-copy-ns mv3 mv4-ns f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80">
      Css zen garden was a highly influential demo 'back in the day.' Most of my colleagues
      and I thought this did a perfect job at illustrating the power of the cascade. You could
      drastically alter a site's visual design without touching even a bit of html.
    </p>
    <p class="lh-title lh-copy-ns mv3 mv4-ns f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80">
      In the beginning, that’s what people sold me as a feature. By writing css, you could
      make a change in one place and have it propagate everywhere. In principle this sounds
      highly desirable. But eleven years later, my experience on both large and small teams is
      that this is the most terrifying thing about css and can cripple an organizations
      ability to iterate on their product.

      After countless implementations of css systems that broke down and became difficult
      to maintain as apps and teams grew larger... I've found I want little to no part of the
      cascade's 'features.'
    </p>
    <p class="lh-title lh-copy-ns mv3 mv4-ns f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80">
      I used to joke that the worst part about front-end development was that the other people
      solving your problems were front-end developers. But in the past few years a lot of very
      smart people have been thinking more about css and this has lead to some fascinating
      discussions around how to build ‘scalable’ ui and how that relates to css. When I first
      started to think about scalability I naturally started to read every blog post and watch
      every tech talk I could get my hands on. There are a number of suggested 'best
      practices' around how sass/less/stylus etc. will help you build maintainable css. How
      mixins can make your code more DRY. How extends will keep your markup clean and pretty
      to look at. How BEM will make your code so perfect you want to cry.

    <p class="lh-title lh-copy-ns mv3 mv4-ns f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80">
      But what is reality? What actually gets shipped to production? What do all of these tips
      and tricks do to our production css? How does it affect the whole team? More important,
      how are your end users affected?
    </p>
    <p class="lh-title lh-copy-ns mv3 mv4-ns f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80">
      When it comes to designing and shipping products I like to think about reality. Which
      can be challenging sometimes. I’ve sat in too many meetings where people don't want to
      hear or talk about reality. They talk in empty phrases about hypothetical possibilities.
      I like to do drugs and talk like that too sometimes. But, if you don't accurately assess
      where you currently are and what your reality is, it can be pretty tough to figure out
      what your problems are. And the chance of finding solutions to unidentified problems is,
      well, not good.

      So there I was, in the fall of 2014, a new employee at an
      <a title="sfdc dot com" href="http://salesforce.com" class="link black underline">award
        winning tech company</a> that had a website. And that website had a lot of css.
      Wanting to familiarize myself with the codebase - I opened up dev tools and started to
      read the site's css.

    <p class="lh-title lh-copy-ns mv3 mv4-ns f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80">
      Some of the code made me laugh:

    <code-snippet></code-snippet>

    <p class="lh-title lh-copy-ns mv3 mv4-ns f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80">
      Eventually, I stumbled across this class of code.
    </p>

    <code-snippet></code-snippet>

    <p class="lh-title lh-copy-ns mv3 mv4-ns f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80">
      I saw this class and thought - well at least you know what it does. Unlike some of the
      other css it seemed like it was very reusable. By anyone who needed to float something
      left.
    </p>
    <p class="lh-title lh-copy-ns mv3 mv4-ns f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80">
      I kept reading and stumbled across this:
    </p>

    <code-snippet></code-snippet>

    <p class="lh-title lh-copy-ns mv3 mv4-ns f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80">
      …followed by this very similar block of code…
    </p>

    <code-snippet></code-snippet>

    <p class="lh-title lh-copy-ns mv3 mv4-ns f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80">
      I found myself wondering what the story was behind this next code block. Is it for
      elements with the class .header-nav-list that aren’t nested inside an element with the
      class .header-nav-container?
    </p>

    <code-snippet></code-snippet>

    <p class="lh-title lh-copy-ns mv3 mv4-ns f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80">
      Here we start to see a mixture of content-semantic (<code>.submenu</code>) with visually
      semantic
      class names (-3col).
    </p>

    <code-snippet></code-snippet>

    <p class="lh-title lh-copy-ns mv3 mv4-ns f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80">
      Css is interesting because unlike other types of code, you are most likely to find the
      most recent code towards the bottom of the file. Reading a css file from start to finish
      will often times reveal in chronological order how a defined system breaks down.
    </p>
    <p class="lh-title lh-copy-ns mv3 mv4-ns f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80">
      In the above examples we see things breaking down to increasingly longer selectors that
      have more and more weight that were only setting one property to one value:
      <code>float: left</code>.
    </p>
    <p class="lh-title lh-copy-ns mv3 mv4-ns f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80">
      Mind you, there are only three options for float. Contrary to one of the code examples
      above, there is no float center. Just left, right, and none.
    </p>
    <p class="lh-title lh-copy-ns mv3 mv4-ns f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80">
      Reading the css made me think about a lot of things. One thing I couldn’t get out of my
      head was - why all this work to change one thing? Why write all that code to just float
      something left?
    </p>
    <p class="lh-title lh-copy-ns mv3 mv4-ns f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80">
      To me, this is a reflection of the mental model most people are in when they are writing
      front-end code. They are generally trying to change one or two things in an interface
      and that’s it. And when you are in this mode of development you want to limit the amount
      of things you break - while also making the change that is being asked for in some jira
      ticket that got assigned to you.
    </p>
    <p class="lh-title lh-copy-ns mv3 mv4-ns f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80">
      I also started to think about communication and how it moves in multiple directions. If
      I’m reading html, I want to know what the css is going to do. If I’m reading css I want
      to know what will happen if I apply it to a block of html. In a great system there is a
      two way street of information. If you look at the css, you can tell what will happen. If
      you look at the html, you know what the code will do.
    </p>
    <p class="lh-title lh-copy-ns mv3 mv4-ns f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80">
      But most front-end systems are not great. You have what I refer to as one-way streets of
      information. If I am looking at a block of html and I can’t find ALL of the css that
      will visually affect how it renders in under 5 seconds, I feel that system is failing.
      So if I ran into the above example:
    </p>

    <code-snippet></code-snippet>

    <p class="lh-title lh-copy-ns mv3 mv4-ns f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80">
      That means I would have to find elements that had both of those classes (but not limited
      to) on an element. But by looking at this block of css I also have no idea if it has
      been redefined elsewhere. So I must grep through the system to find definitions for
      container-inner and promo-status. By the time I found those definitions - I would
      probably have forgotten what I was trying to do in which case I’d leave my desk and go
      get coffee.
    </p>

    <p class="lh-title lh-copy-ns mv3 mv4-ns f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80">
      On the flip side think about this example:
    </p>

    <code-snippet></code-snippet>

    <p class="lh-title lh-copy-ns mv3 mv4-ns f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80">
      I’d presume that this would make an element have red text. I was traditionally told this
      is a horrible name for a class. But I quite like it. The only way I’d think it was bad
      is if it set the color property to: purple, blue, or any other color that wasn’t red. Or
      if it was mutated a few times to a few different shades of red. But more on that later.
    </p>

    <p class="lh-title lh-copy-ns mv3 mv4-ns f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80">
      And if I saw this block of html:
    </p>

    <code-snippet></code-snippet>

    <p class="lh-title lh-copy-ns mv3 mv4-ns f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80">
      I’d know without looking at the css what was going to happen. This is what I call a
      two-way street of information. It’s easy to learn a group of small classes that do one
      thing well and can be reused in any context. There should be a one to one mapping
      between a class and it’s definition. Having a class that has multiple definitions be
      being redefined depending on context doesn’t solve problems, it creates them. The
      concept of immutability is not new - but we’ve ignored it in the css community for far
      too long. Imagine if you had a function called ‘filesize’ where you passed it a filename
      and it returned the filesize. That sounds pretty great. But imagine if sometimes it
      returned the amount of lines in the file. That doesn’t sound great at all does it. Well
      that’s what you’re doing anytime you redefine a css class. It’s the worst for people who
      are good at debugging css. It’s even more horrible for people new to the cascade.
    </p>
    <p class="lh-title lh-copy-ns mv3 mv4-ns f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80">
      When we look at convoluted css, we must remember that behind every css ruleset is a
      story. Maybe the author was on a time crunch and didn’t have time to look up if there
      was some previously written code they could reuse. Maybe they don’t care about css at
      all and the second something works they save, commit, and go back to writing monads.
      When I write bad code, it isn’t because I’m not trying to write good code. There are
      always other forces at work. What are the forces that work against writing clean
      reusable code? How do we get rid of them? I’ve spent the last few years doing a lot of
      user testing centered around how people write their own front-end code, consume other
      peoples front-end code, and think about developing UI in general. It has been a pretty
      valuable experience (as user-testing generally is). I’ve learned a lot about the
      different mental models people use - and how to try to construct systems that allow
      people of all abilities to spend more time designing / building and less time
      debugging/fighting/crying.
    </p>
    <p class="lh-title lh-copy-ns mv3 mv4-ns f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80">
      <b>Sidenote:</b> <i>(I don’t know where to fit this in)</i> <br> Before I started doing
      both performance and user testing I did not like the idea of oocss/atomic css. I really
      liked writing monolithic classes and traversing the dom with my selectors. It made a ton
      of sense to me and I was able to build out a lot of websites that way. Running tests and
      testing my assumptions helped inform a lot of how I think about code now. I’m not very
      interested in what I can do with css. I’m interested at this point in what I can help
      groups of people do with css.
    </p>
    <p class="lh-title lh-copy-ns mv3 mv4-ns f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80">
      If you’re going to build a new component, or change a piece of UI in your app - what do
      you do? I don’t know anyone that reads all the available css in the app to see if there
      is something they can reuse. Who has time to read thousands of lines of code before they
      start working!? Even if people do have the time, I have not found that this is their
      first instinct on how to get going. I don’t blame them.
    </p>
    <p class="lh-title lh-copy-ns mv3 mv4-ns f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80">
      Even if you did read all of the available css and stumbled upon some code that you think
      might be reusable - what if someone edits it later? If you are starting from the
      assumption that your css isn't reusable, your first instinct is to write new css. But
      most likely you aren't creating a new classification of visual styles. In my experience
      it is likely that you are replicating visual styles that already exist.

      Salesforce may pay people a lot of money. And they may win Forbes awards for being the
      most innovative. But they are not known for hiring people who are great at css. Their
      css is anything but innovative. After reading all of the css and going through bits of
      crying, head-scratching, and laughing out loud - I determined that this problem must
      only exist at Salesforce. Surely awesome companies like Medium, GitHub, Adobe, and
      Pinterest didn’t have this problem. They’ve hired some of the most amazing css
      developers I’ve ever met. They must have figured out how to scale css.
    </p>
    <p class="lh-title lh-copy-ns mv3 mv4-ns f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80">
      Naturally I opened up their sites and started to read their css too. Line by line. From
      start to finish. I wanted to see what everyone’s reality really was.
    </p>

    <p class="lh-title lh-copy-ns mv3 mv4-ns f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80">
      I found the exact same things.
    </p>

    <p class="lh-title lh-copy-ns mv3 mv4-ns f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80">
      Let’s take a look at just the rulesets that set things to display none:
    </p>

    <ul class="list lh-copy pl0 mt0">
      <li>
        <a class="link underline dim black"
           href="https://gist.github.com/mrmrs/786241f0a5fade0324e2"
           title="GitHub">GitHub</a>
      </li>

           title="Adobe">Adobe</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="lh-title lh-copy-ns mv3 mv4-ns f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80">
      That’s a lot of code setting things to display: none. If you look at the files above ask
      yourself some questions: Do they seem like they follow the principles behind DRY? Does
      this seem like a bunch of code you would know how to reuse?
    </p>
    <p class="lh-title lh-copy-ns mv3 mv4-ns f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80">
      If I’m going to write css, I want it to be reusable. If someone isn’t going to reuse it
      - it seems pretty useless.
    </p>
    <p class="lh-title lh-copy-ns mv3 mv4-ns f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80">
      So what does DRY even mean? Because you do have to repeat yourself somewhere! You either
      repeat yourself in html or in css. But no matter how good you are at css - you can’t
      build out a new component without editing html. But, it is possible to build a new
      component without writing a single line of css. And this applies to changing UI too. You
      should be able to change most things, just by editing html.
    </p>
    <p class="lh-title lh-copy-ns mv3 mv4-ns f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80">
      When you repeat yourself in html, there isn’t any real damage to file size (read:
      multi-class patterns will not bloat your html). A user doesn’t have to download every
      html file from your website to view one page. Yet most web sites are architected in a
      way that require you to download the css for the entire site when you try to view one
      page. This is a broken model.
    </p>
    <p class="lh-title lh-copy-ns mv3 mv4-ns f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80">
      The files I referenced above are the result of css authors generating really long
      selectors that add a lot of weight to your cascade to do one or two things. And as time
      goes on there are more and more things in your cascade to override. So your selectors
      get longer and longer, your file sizes get bigger and bigger, and the amount of time you
      spend debugging css is going to go up and up and up.
    </p>
    <p class="lh-title lh-copy-ns mv3 mv4-ns f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80">
      In this model, you will never stop writing css. Refactoring css is hard and time
      consuming. Deleting unused css is hard and time consuming. And more often than not -
      it’s not work people are excited to do. So what happens? People keep writing more and
      more css.
    </p>

      This affects scalability in two ways. One, it makes it harder to work on your app
      because you can't realistically memorize all of the css in your app. And if it isn't
      internalized it isn't likely to be reused. It also means that your users have an
      increasing amount of code to download. And if you think “oh but it will never get that
      bad, gzip will save the day” - well you’re wrong. Pinterest has more than 1mb of
      uncompressed css spread out over 5 files. Once gzipped it is still a whopping 159kb. <b>That
      is a lot of css</b>. 97% of it isn’t used on the homepage. I’d rather just try and send
      my users the 3% they do need.

      Part of this code bloat is an attachment to authoring ‘content-semantic’ class names.
      Honestly I’m surprised you can find people that still think this isn’t the worst idea
      ever. <a class="link dim underline black"

      Nicolas Gallagher already wrote the mic drop piece on why this doesn’t work.</a> But for
      some reason you still find people arguing for its merits as a silver bullet solution.
      Personally I think most of the internet is unnecessarily broken. So I assume everything
      we have been taught is most likely wrong.
    </p>
    <p class="lh-title lh-copy-ns mv3 mv4-ns f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80">
      This is where we come to the crux of the problem I have with any system that requires
      you to map visual styles to components in your css. Content semantics have <b
      class="fw4 ttu">nothing to do with visual styles</b>. When I used to build things
      with legos I never thought ‘oh this is a piece for an engine block’ I thought ‘oh cool
      this is a 1x4 blue lego and I can do anything I want with it’. It didn't matter if I was
      building an underwater aquanauts base or an airplane - I knew exactly how to use that
      lego block.
    </p>
    <p class="lh-title lh-copy-ns mv3 mv4-ns f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80">
      It’s all about lego bits. Because I never needed to re-contextualize my understanding of
      lego blocks. I could use them across ‘projects’ and they were always the same. I dream
      of this world in front-end development. I want lego blocks that work everywhere because
      there is serious power in leveraging solutions that are project agnostic.

      Outside of some brand specific background-images, gradients, and colors etc., the
      overwhelming majority of css you would need for your site has already been written. Yet
      we continue as a community to constantly reinvent the wheel. Which is starting to feel
      like building a camera from scratch every time you want to take a photo. I totally think
      building cameras from scratch is cool and a worthwhile endeavor. But I don’t want to do
      it every time I am going to take a photo. I just want to go take photos.

      When I read about or listen to ideas on how to scale an app’s css - most of the talk is
      about how to write css. The real way to scale css, is to stop writing css. Abstract out
      the things you use most and move to a multi-class pattern where you compose visual
      patterns in your html. You might be amazed at how quickly your team starts to move.
    </p>
    <p class="lh-title lh-copy-ns mv3 mv4-ns f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80">
      There are a lot of problems that come along with people writing css. Inconsistent
      values, the introduction of magic numbers, duplicate code, non-responsive patterns. I’m
      sure there are others.
    </p>
    <p class="lh-title lh-copy-ns mv3 mv4-ns f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80">
      If you create a system that is flexible and powerful, and pull from that, you might find
      your designs to be more harmonious. You might spend less time debugging the cascade.
      Your pages will probably load faster. But who knows. Maybe that won’t work for you at
      all. All I know is the current model is definitely not going to work.
    </p>
    <p class="lh-title lh-copy-ns mv3 mv4-ns f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80">
      Writing new css should be the exception, not the rule.

    <h3 class="f3">Parting Thoughts</h3>
    <p class="lh-title lh-copy-ns mv3 mv4-ns f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80">
      If you have never read your outputted css from start to finish - I recommend it as an
      amazing way to learn a lot about css and how people use it. After I read salesforce’s
      css I started reading css in entirety for many sites. I still do this! I learn something
      new every time.
    </p>
    <p class="lh-title lh-copy-ns mv3 mv4-ns f5 f4-ns fw3 black-80">
      Don’t take this as dogma. The real point of this whole piece is to encourage you to go
      test your assumptions. Not many people sit with other people building UI and just
      *observe* how they build out new features or refactor old ones. User-testing is such a
      great exercise to learn about how people use things. You can learn a lot from people who
      are great at writing front-end code and also people who are brand new to it. I wouldn’t
      have learned much of this if I just sat around and tried to solve problems by myself or
      read all the latest hip blog posts. The reality is lots of people with varying levels of
      agency will touch your front-end code and you should design a system that works for
      everyone.

      Thank you to everyone who has given me feedback on these thoughts over the last few
      years. And special thanks to the trailblazers that had the guts to challenge existing
      best practices and gave me the courage to do the same. I'm looking at you
